Oblivion Spacegray
------------------

A Sublime Text Color Scheme based on Oblivion theme of Gedit in Ubuntu 11.10. Customized to fit ST3 "Spacegray" theme.

This variation is more of a personal version that I use everyday rather than completely aestetically unbiased one. You are, however, free to contribute.

### Installation

Currently, the only option is to clone this repository and to put it in Sublime's Packages folder.
