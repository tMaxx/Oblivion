Oblivion
========

A Sublime Text Color Scheme based on Oblivion theme of Gedit in Ubuntu 11.10.

Slightly modified version: different background, brighter comments. For readability. And because I like it better.
There is no "Soda Dark" variant here - I just don't use it.

Changelog:
- Modify CSS tag color, pink is overrated
- Add support for LESS stylesheet language (for use with LESS-sublime plugin)
- Small sync w/ upstream
