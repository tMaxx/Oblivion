Oblivion
========

A Sublime Text Color Scheme based on Oblivion theme of Gedit in Ubuntu 11.10.

For "Soda Dark" variant of this scheme head down to section *Installation*.

Changelog:
- Tweaks for function names and variables (more balanced colors)
- Some colors & appearance rolled back to originals
- Change CSS tag color, pink is overrated
- Add support for LESS stylesheet language (for use with LESS-sublime plugin)
- Small sync w/ upstream

## Installation

*Different version of this theme is available through Package Control (see https://github.com/hussani/Oblivion). You may want to stick to that one.*
Another version is provided by jbrooksuk - see https://github.com/jbrooksuk/Oblivion for instructions.

If you're still eager to try my particular version type this in console:

### Linux

	cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
	git clone https://github.com/tMaxx/Oblivion.git
